Mc server Announcer is a Quilt Mod used to announce your server to the LAN network using the broadcast ip : `255.255.255.255`
  
## Usage

### How to use ?

Download the mod jar (not the sources) and place it in the mods folder of your Quilt server.

### Actual Fonctionalities

 - [x]  Auto detect the motd of the server to use it in the server name
 - [X]  Auto detect the server port
 - [X]  When the motd have a line break it replaces it with three spaces, because the LAN server name can't handle a line break.
